    Question two.


    This app is build using :
    
    - fastapi
    - uvicorn

    I also had to download the "requests" package.


    According to the question, this app gets data about certain products from another rest API and allows the user to:

    * get all the products that are available,
    * get one product using it's id and
    * create or add a new product in the database.

    As you can notice in the config file, I created the API app that serves this one. It is build on top of a mysql database called #'classicmodels'#, that we worked one in the Advanced Database class through this semester.

    This project was particularly interesting because I learned a lot concerning python as a programming language (new syntax), about the framework: Django, rest_framework, fastapi, uvicorn and especially about APIs - how they work.
